about=This is a core-enhancement plugin that allow the implementation of complex
    dynamic filters in QGIS attribute forms.

    This plugin provides a "Form Value Relation" widget (very similar clone of
    QgsValueRelationWidgetWrapper) that refreshes the related item values on
    every change in the form values and that makes available the form values to the
    context. The expression is re-evaluated every time the form changes if
    the changed fields are part of the expression.

    A custom expression function "CurrentFormValue()" allow to read the form
    values from  the expression context.

    This widget can be used to implement drill-down forms, where the values available
    in one field depend on the values of other fields.
